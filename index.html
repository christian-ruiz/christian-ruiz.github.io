        <h3>COVID live updates and predictive analysis</h3>
        <p>
            In this project, data is being streamed continuously from the World Health Organization
            (WHO) that updates daily with new information on the spread of the virus. In this project, 
            our python file uses webscraping in order to scrape a pdf file, using tabula, visualize 
            and make predictions from that data.
